# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time.

## Rules
- Rock beats Scissors.
- Scissors beat Paper.
- Paper beats Rock.
- Player who reaches a score of 5 first win the game.

## Purpose
This project is my first javascript project, I am given it as assignment by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to show that I have understood the first part of the basics of javascript, and also to show that I can solve and implement a pretty basic computer program like the rock-paper-scissor program.
